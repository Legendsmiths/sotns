title: Theian Calendar and Time

There are thirteen moons, each with a duration of 28 days, divided into 4 weeks of 7 days each. The start of a moon is marked when its waxing sliver shows first light while crossing the Astral Sign at the astral zenith.

1 year = 13 moons = 4 weeks = 28 days
1 season = 13 weeks = 91 days (lunar cycles and solar cycles are separate)
- Spring starts on Evenglow (day 1, week 1)
- Summer starts on Estival (day 92, week 14)
- Fall starts on Evengloam (day 183, week 27)
- Winter starts on Hibernal (day 274, week 40) 
- Titanfall extends Hibernal 1 day that exists outside the calendar
1 day = 6 hextiles = 24 hours
1 hour = 4 quarters = 60 minutes
1 minute = 10 rounds = 60 seconds

[Astral Calendar]

The celebration of Titanfall every four years occurs on a special day outside of the normal calendar, a leap day that accounts readjusts the calendar to accuracy. It is also easily marked by the last light of the last moon of the 10th month that persists one day longer than usual. This last waning light is celebrated as the last breath of the titans as Draconus smothered them. This temporal drift is attributed to the cosmic impact of Titanfall when the titans were destroyed or imprisoned by Death during Creation.
